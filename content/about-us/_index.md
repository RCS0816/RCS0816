**We are the RCS08-16**.

A group dedicated to sticking random pieces of paper on the wall and negotiating with admin to reduce assessments (Thanks Dr. Eksplosive!).

We ensure the positive peace within our land in S08-16, the Marcosian Republic, along with protecting the free speech of all students. May S08-16 prosper well into the future!

*Note:* We do not follow any major political ideologies, such as Communism. If you are interested in joining our neighboring republic and its ruling entity, the Federated Students' Defensive Coalition, please contact me. I will direct you to the correct person. We are only a managerial entity and do not focus on rulership and the overpoliticization of Marcosia.
