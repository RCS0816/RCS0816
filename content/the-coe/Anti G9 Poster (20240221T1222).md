After AMITPP members came into the S08-16 and acted in an unprofessional and disruptive manner, even throwing away the "Mr. Marcos
I need help" sign, the following message was made, written in Rikatisy√Ø to prevent any administration intervention. The English translation 
reads: 

"Our homeland is the holy nation of the Revolutionary Committee! Motherfuckers who disrespect the culture of S08-16, fuck off from our country!"
