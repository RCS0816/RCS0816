This is a COE post made at an unknown time most likely by [Kasreti](/about-us). It highlights the repetitiveness and the consistent lies that the school and candidates have been delivering in the Presidential Elections. They should be boycotted to ensure that no innocent students' minds are lured into the politician's promises which will never be delivered, unless if a radical change within admin happens in the near future.

Boycott the elections. This year is no different.
