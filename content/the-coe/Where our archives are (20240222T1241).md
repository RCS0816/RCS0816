After lots of searching in our storage units, we gave up trying to find the papers that were a part of the old COE (Second Generation). Specifically, the war letters where a cold war broke out between the Communist Party of the OFS Students and us. After a weekend of MUN, it was revealed that ***they stole our archives***.

You all may not see many posts with the tag `Gen 2` due to this reason. The sheets must be recovered before that. Contact Kasreti, ezntek, or Dr. Eksplosive if you spot any papers. You are all free to use whips to punish AMITdoubleP members that you spot (although you will be liable for any admin intervention).
